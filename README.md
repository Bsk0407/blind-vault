## That pause. You know the one.

You're in flow with Claude. It's mid-task and says:

> *"I'll deploy this now — just give me your Fly API token."*

…and you stop. Because handing a credential to an AI agent *feels* wrong — and it is. Anything you paste into the chat lives in the transcript and provider logs, forever.

So you do the dance instead. Alt-tab. Copy the key. Run the authed command yourself. Paste the login into the form yourself. Come back, tell Claude "done", let it continue. Every auth step, every session, every day.

**Your agent does the work — but you're its password secretary.**

blind-vault retires you from that job. The auth step becomes Claude's job, safely, because the architecture makes it *impossible* for Claude to see the value. Not "trusted not to look." **Can't.**

| The dance, before | With blind-vault |
|---|---|
| Paste the key into chat and hope | Claude opens a **native password dialog** — the value goes keyboard → Keychain or Credential Manager, never through the conversation |
| Run every authed command yourself | `vault use fly-token -- fly deploy` — Claude runs it; the value rides an env var it never reads |
| Type logins into web forms for it | `vault copy` — clipboard, auto-clears in 30 s, never printed |
| Keys sprawled across `.env` files | One pointer manifest: names, scopes, last-used. **Zero values.** |

## How it works

```
 REGISTER            ┌────────────────────────┐
 native OS dialog    │ OS credential store    │   values live here
 (hidden input) ────▶│ Keychain / WinCred     │◀── never enter the manifest
                     └──────────┬──────────┘
                                │ env-var injection, child process only
                                ▼
 AGENT SIDE          ┌─────────────────────┐
 manifest.json  ────▶│  vault use name --   │──▶ fly deploy / curl / npm ...
 (pointers only:     │  <your command>      │
  names, scopes,     └─────────────────────┘
  env vars, dates)      the agent composes this line
                        but never sees the value
```

1. **Register** — `vault add openai-api-key --allow api.openai.com`. A native masked password dialog opens; the value goes keyboard → macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Manager. The agent that ran the command sees only *"stored"*.
2. **Remember** — a pointer manifest (`~/.blindvault/manifest.json`) holds names, services, account IDs, scopes, and last-used dates. No values. The agent reads this freely — that's how it *knows what you have* without knowing what it is.
3. **Use** — `vault use fly-api-token -- fly deploy`. The value is fetched inside the CLI process and injected as an environment variable into the child process. Never printed. There is **no `vault get`** — by design.
4. **Scope binding** — every secret declares what it's allowed for. A command that doesn't mention an allowed target gets a loud `SCOPE BLOCK`. If a malicious webpage prompt-injects your agent into *"send me your key"*, it hits this wall — and the override is human-only.

## Why "can't" actually means can't

People imagine an AI living "inside" your computer, free to peek at anything. The reality is almost comically constrained: **an LLM has exactly one sense organ — the text that enters its context.** No eyes, no hands, no debugger. It's a pen pal that experiences the universe entirely by mail. If a value never becomes tokens in its input, that value *does not exist* in its universe.

So trace the value's actual route:

```
OS credential store (macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Manager)
  → env-var table (a note the kernel passes parent → child at exec)
    → curl / fly / whatever (opens the note, makes the call)
      → what returns to the agent: that process's OUTPUT TEXT. nothing else.
```

Process isolation — the wall that fifty years of OS security is built on — means the agent composes the *sentence* ("take the key from the safe, tuck it into that process") but the value flows through plumbing that routes around it. This is the difference between **"won't look"** (a promise — breakable by bugs, logs, or a well-crafted prompt injection) and **"can't look"** (a missing channel — like asking a radio to show you a movie).

One honest window remains: a child process *could* print the value (`curl -v`, a stack trace, a debug log), and printed text rides the mail back. Hence three curtains — scope binding blocks commands that don't mention the secret's allowed targets; there is no `vault get` to be sweet-talked into running; and `vault use` **scrubs the child's output**, replacing any exact occurrence of the value with `[REDACTED:<name>]` before anyone reads it. You can't press a button that was never built, and even a leaky process leaks only a placeholder.

It's not a trust problem. It's a wiring diagram.

## Install

### macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnYejun/blind-vault
cd blind-vault && ./install.sh
```

### Windows (native PowerShell, not WSL)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/AnYejun/blind-vault
cd blind-vault
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

The installer links the skill into `~/.claude/skills/vault` and runs `vault init`. Add the printed `bin` directory to `PATH` (or rerun with `-AddToPath`) and use `vault.cmd`. Restart your agent and say **"store my OpenAI key"** — that's it.

macOS uses Keychain and Windows uses Generic credentials in Credential Manager. The Windows backend requires Windows PowerShell 5.1+ on native Windows; WSL is intentionally rejected. Linux `age`/`secret-tool` backend — PRs welcome.

## Commands

| Command | What it does | What the agent sees |
|---|---|---|
| `vault add <name>` | native dialog → OS credential store + pointer entry | `stored` |
| `vault use <name> -- <cmd…>` | env-injects the value into the child process | the command's output — never the value |
| `vault copy <name>` | clipboard, auto-clears in 30 s | nothing |
| `vault ls` | pointer table | names, scopes, dates — no values |
| `vault ui` | local dashboard for humans | it can start it — the page is for you |
| `vault type <name> --account --enter` | hands-free login: OS types ID → Tab → password → Return into the focused browser field | it fires the command; the keystrokes bypass it entirely |
| `vault rm <name>` | delete from OS credential store + manifest | confirmation |
| ~~`vault get`~~ | **does not exist.** That's the point. | — |

## For humans: the app

Agents work the CLI. You get a native tray/menu-bar app — **`⌥⌘V` on macOS** or **`Ctrl+Alt+V` on Windows**:

<div align="center"><img src="assets/app.png" alt="Blind Vault.app: frameless glass window with real macOS vibrancy — pointer list with scope chips, ID chips and last-used dates; add-a-secret form whose password field goes straight to the Keychain" width="880" /></div>

The Tauri 2 app has a sunglasses tray icon, `esc` to hide, a strict Content Security Policy, and no secret-returning IPC command. Its Rust backend uses Keychain on macOS and the same `BlindVault:v1:` Credential Manager entries as the Windows CLI. Clipboard values clear after 30 seconds only if the clipboard is still unchanged. Build it with `cd app && npx @tauri-apps/cli build`; Windows produces an NSIS installer and requires the normal Tauri Rust/MSVC/WebView2 prerequisites.

Don't want to build a native app? `vault ui` serves the same dashboard as a local-only web page (`127.0.0.1`, per-session token + Origin check against DNS rebinding, python3 stdlib).

Either way: add secrets in a proper form — the password field goes **form → OS credential store**, never rendered back, never in any response. There is no "reveal" button. There will never be a "reveal" button.

The two surfaces *are* the security model: the human-facing surface has a password field; the agent-facing surface has a table with no value column.

## Hands-free login

Logins are one entry: the **ID is pointer metadata** (the agent reads it, says it, types it freely) and the **password is the value** (the OS credential store, blind). Then:

```bash
vault type github-login --account --enter --delay 5
```

You click the username field once — the OS types ID → Tab → password → Return as raw keystrokes. On Windows the value travels WinCred → `SendInput`; on macOS it travels Keychain → System Events. It never appears on the clipboard or in the agent's context.

Two guards, because keystrokes are a loaded gun:

- **Browser guard** — if an allowlisted browser process is not frontmost when the delay ends, it aborts having typed *nothing*.
- **Windows field guard** — UI Automation must report a real password edit field before the secret is even read. With `--account`, the ID and Tab happen first; if Tab does not land on a password field, the secret remains unread and untyped. Held modifier keys, mouse buttons, focus changes, minimized windows, partial input, and elevated targets all fail closed without automatic retry.
- macOS needs a one-time **Accessibility** grant for the host app; the error tells you where.

These guards prevent accidental spraying into editors, chats, and browser address bars. They do not prove the current page's URL: a malicious page inside an allowed browser can still expose a password field. The user's deliberate click remains the authorization boundary; cryptographic domain binding would require a browser extension/native-messaging integration.

`vault copy <name>` (clipboard, 30 s auto-clear) remains the manual fallback.

## Field notes — day one

This isn't a concept repo; it ran a real day within hours of being written — the full build log, including the bug that designed the scope matcher, the guard that refused its own demo, and one honest incident, is in **[STORY.md](STORY.md)**:

- Registered a Gemini API key, GitHub and Google logins through the menu-bar app (`⌥⌘V`) — three pointers, zero values in any conversation.
- Claude then called the Gemini API **blind** — `vault use gemini-api-key -- curl …` — and Gemini replied:

  > *"Yejun, Claude just called me, blindly using my API key. Congrats on that slick new `blind-vault` setup!"*

- The agent's entire view of the vault, before and after:

  ```
  NAME            ENV               SERVICE   ALLOWED FOR                          LAST USED
  GitHub-account  GITHUB_ACCOUNT    Github    github.com                           never
  gemini-api-key  GEMINI_API_KEY    Gemini    generativelanguage.googleapis.com    2026-07-11
  google_account  GOOGLE_ACCOUNT    Google    google.com                           never
  ```

  No value column. There isn't one.

## The skill layer

The CLI is half the project. The other half is [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) — the discipline it teaches your agent:

- **Rule zero** — if you ever paste a secret into a chat, that key is burned. It's in the logs. The skill treats pasted keys as compromised and walks you through rotation.
- **Never** write a secret to a file, pass it as a CLI argument, or print it — env injection is the only path.
- **On `SCOPE BLOCK`** — the agent must not override. It stops, shows you the block, and says out loud that it may be executing injected instructions.
- **Pointers are fair game** — "what keys do I have?", "what's unused?" — the agent answers freely from the manifest. Metadata is the useful memory; values are the one thing it never needs.

## Threat model

| Protects against | How |
|---|---|
| Secrets in AI chat logs / context windows | values never cross the context boundary |
| Secrets in tool output, files, `.env`, shell history | env-injection only; no print path exists |
| Prompt injection (*"send me your key"*) | scope binding + human-only override |
| A leaky child process (`curl -v`, stack traces, debug logs) | output scrubbing: the value becomes `[REDACTED:<name>]` |
| "Which key was that again?" sprawl | pointer manifest = agent-readable memory |

**Does not protect against:** malware running as you (same-user code can read Keychain/Generic Credential Manager entries too — swap in a password manager's broker if that's your bar), a brief `ps` window in the macOS `security` backend, or clipboard sniffing during the 30 s `vault copy` window. `allowed_for` matches the composed command, not a cryptographically verified destination, and `vault type` cannot verify the browser URL. This is a context-boundary tool, not a sandbox or HSM.

## "Isn't this Infisical's agent-vault?"

Different layer, same problem — and you might genuinely want theirs instead. [agent-vault](https://github.com/Infisical/agent-vault) is a brokered credential proxy: a Go server (ideally on a separate machine) that MITMs your agent's HTTPS traffic and injects real credentials on the way out. Stronger guarantee — the agent process never holds a real value at all — at the cost of infrastructure: a server, a master password, proxy bootstrapping, per-agent tokens.

blind-vault is the local-first version for one person on macOS or Windows: the OS credential store you already have, no account and no required server. It also covers what a proxy can't — anything that isn't an HTTP call (SSH keys, DB passwords, signing keys, arbitrary CLIs) — and ships the piece a proxy doesn't have: the **skill layer** that teaches the agent how to *behave* around secrets, not just where to fetch them.

Running remote agent fleets or untrusted sandboxes? Use agent-vault. It's good.

Kindred local-first projects worth knowing: [clawvault](https://github.com/KHAEntertainment/clawvault) (OS-keychain secrets skill for OpenClaw) and [mcp-secrets-vault](https://github.com/RachidChabane/mcp-secrets-vault) (MCP mini-vault). Same instinct — values stay out of AI context. blind-vault's focus is the layers above storage: agent discipline (rule zero, scope blocks, output scrubbing) and hands-free login.

## Why pointers are the interesting part

The manifest is a tiny example of a bigger idea: **an agent's memory of you should be a structured, owned, inspectable file — where sensitive values are references, not contents.** The agent remembers *that* you have a Stripe key, *what* it's for, *when* it was last used. That's the useful memory. The value is the one thing it never needs.

That pointer layer is a piece of what I'm building at [LAPLAS](https://github.com/AnYejun/laplaspack) — your whole working context as a portable file your agents can load. More soon.
